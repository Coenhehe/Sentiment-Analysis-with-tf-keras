SET UP AN ENVIRONMENT BEFORE RUNNING THE NOTEBOOK
- install conda 24.5.0 from the shell
- when choosing a kernel in the notebook, set up a new venv with conda py 3.11.5 (compatibility issues cos of dropped support in newer versions)

Also, if you are going to train the model yourself, install the Sentiment-140 .csv dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140) and add it to the cloned repository, in the same directory as the CPCoursebook.ipynb

Now just run the cells one by one to train the model, or skip to step 5, where you can use the already-trained model quickly
