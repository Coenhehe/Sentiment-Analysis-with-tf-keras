SET UP AN ENVIRONMENT BEFORE RUNNING THE NOTEBOOK
- install conda 24.5.0 from the shell
- when choosing a kernel in the notebook, set up a new venv with conda py 3.11.5 (compatibility issues cos of dropped support in newer versions)

Now just run the cells one by one to train the model, or skip to step 5, where you can use the already-trained model quickly
